                    <h3><em>Why Software?</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        I have decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering because I have a passion for
                        figuring out the answers to problems. In my previous lines of work, I was always known
                        as the "problem solver", the person that everyone would go to if they needed help. I
                        have always enjoyed a team atmosphere in my work life. Specifically, working together
                        to exceed our collective potential. I believe that my drive to over-achieve and produce
                        results will provide me a successful career as a Software Engineer.

                        <li>New York Mets baseball</li>
                        </ol>
                     <p>The New York Mets baseball club has especially taught me that even though things might not always
                        go your way, there is always an opportunity to right the ship the next day.
